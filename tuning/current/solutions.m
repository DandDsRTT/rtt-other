  (*   
  our goal is to find the generator tuning map not merely with minimaxed damage, 
  but where the next-highest damage is minimaxed as well, and in fact every next-highest damage is minimaxed, all the way down.
  the tuning which has all damages minimaxed within minimaxed all the way down like this we can call a "nested-minimax".
  it's the only sensible optimum given a desire for minimax damage, so in general we can simply still call it "minimax".
  though people have sometimes distinguished this tuning from the range of minimax tunings with a prefix, 
  such as "TIPTOP tuning" versus "TOP tunings", although there is no value in "TOP tunings" given the existence of "TIPTOP",
  so you may as well just keep calling it "TOP" and refine its definition. anyway...
  
  the `findAllNestedMinimaxTuningsFromPolytopeVertices` function this function calls may come back with more than one result. 
  the clever way we compute a nested-minimax uses the same polytope vertex searching method used for the that first pass, but now with a twist.
  so in the basic case, this method finds the vertices of a tuning polytope for a temperament.
  this is the area inside of which the targeted intervals are as close as possible to just (by the definition of minimax damage, anyway).
  so now, instead of running it on the case of the original temperament versus JI, we run it on a distorted version of this case.
  specifically, we run it on a case distorted so that the previous minimaxes are locked down.
  
  we achieve this by picking one of these minimax tunings and offset the just side by it. 
  it doesn't matter which minimax tuning we choose, by the way; they're not sorted, and we simply take the first one.
  the corresponding distortion to the mapped side is trickier, 
  involving the differences between this arbitrarily-chosen minimax tuning and each of the other minimax tunings.
  note that after this distortion, the original rank and dimensionality of the temperament will no longer be recognizable.
  
  we then we search for polytope vertices of this minimax-locked distorted situation.
  and we repeatedly do this until we eventually find a unique, nested-minimax optimum. 
  once we've done that, though, our result isn't in the form of a generators tuning map yet. it's still distorted.
  well, with each iteration, we've been keeping track of the distortion applied, so that in the end we could undo them all.
  after undoing those, voilÃ , we're done!

  here we're iterating by index of the targeted intervals,

  but this doesn't necessarily happen, and if it does, it's handled by the function that calls this function)
  until by the final pass they are what we want to return.
  
  there's an inner loop by candidate tuning, and since that list is shrinking each time, the size of the inner loop changes.
  in other words, we're not covering an m \[Times] n rectangular grid's worth of possibilities; more like a jagged triangle.
  
  note that because the damages have all been sorted in descending order,
  these target "indices" do not actually correspond to an individual targeted interval.

  then compare each third-closest-to-minimum, etc.
  the count of target indices we iterate over is a running total; 
  each time it is increased, it goes up by the present generator count plus 1.
  why it increases by that amount is a bit of a mystery to me, but perhaps someone can figure it out and let me know.

  (* here we iterate over every combination of r (rank = generator count, in the basic case) targets 
  and for each of those combinations, looks at all permutations of their directions. 
  these are the vertices of the maximum damage tuning polytope. each is a generator tuning map. the minimum of these will be the minimax tuning.
  
  e.g. for target intervals 3/2, 5/4, and 5/3, with 2 generators, we'd look at three combinations (3/2, 5/4) (3/2, 5/3) (5/4, 5/3)
  and for the first combination, we'd look at both 3/2 \[Times] 5/4 = 15/8 and 3/2 \[Divide] 5/4 = 6/5.
  
  then what we do with each of those combo perm vertices is build a constraint matrix. 
  we'll apply this constraint matrix to a typical linear equation of the form Ax = b, 
  where A is a matrix, b is a vector, and x is another vector, the one we're solving for.
  in our case our matrix A is M, our mapping, b is our primes tuning map p, and x is our generators tuning map g.
  
  e.g. when the targets are just the primes (and thus an identity matrix we can ignore),
  and the temperament we're tuning is 12-ET with M = [12 19 28] and standard interval basis so p = [logâ2 logâ3 logâ5],
  then we have [12 19 28][gâ] = [logâ2 logâ3 logâ5], or a system of three equations:
  
  12gâ = logâ2
  19gâ = logâ3
  28gâ = logâ5
  
  Obviously not all of those can be true, but that's the whole point: we linear solve for the closest possible gâ that satisfies all well.
  
  Now suppose we get the constraint matrix [1 1 0]. We multiply both sides of the setup by that:
  
  [1 1 0][12 19 28][gâ] = [1 1 0][logâ2 logâ3 logâ5]
  [31][gâ] = [logâ2 + logâ3]
  
  This leaves us with only a single equation:
  
  31gâ = logâ6
  
  Or in other words, this tuning makes 6/1 pure, and divides it into 31 equal parts.
  If this temperament's mapping says it's 12 steps to 2/1 and 19 steps to 3/1, and it takes 31 steps to a pure 6/1,
  that implies that whatever damage there is on 2/1 is equal to whatever damage there is on 3/1, since they apparently cancel out.
  
  This constraint matrix [1 1 0] means that the target combo was 2/1 and 3/1, 
  because those are the targets corresponding to its nonzero elements.
  And both nonzero elements are +1 meaning that both targets are combined in the same direction.
  If the targeted intervals list had been [3/2, 4/3, 5/4, 8/5, 5/3, 6/5] instead, and the constraint matrix [1 0 0 0 -1 0],
  then that's 3/2 \[Divide] 5/3 = 5/2.
  
  The reason why we need all the permutations is because they're actually anchored 
  with the first targeted interval always in the super direction.

(* based on https://en.xen.wiki/w/Target_tunings#Minimax_tuning, 
where unchanged-octave diamond minimax-U "minimax" is described;
however, this computation method is in general actually a solution for minisum tunings, not minimax tunings. 
it only lucks out and works for minimax due to the pure-octave-constraint 
and nature of the tonality diamond targeted interval set,
namely that the places where damage to targets are equal is the same where other targets are pure.

(* TODO: W/R/T COMPLEXITY SIZE FACTOR REFACTOR: handle sum polytope solution 
this is so disgusting how irregular this is, 
how many variations and slices/dices of the info it needs that no other solution needs... 
you can read in both `targetingAll.m` and `targetingList.m` that it is the "problem child"
anything can be done about it? 
- if I can't, then I've contemplated keeping better track of all the possibilities that follow the pattern I started
of `targetingList` version and `targetingAll` version of the same data to be used for solution functions
like, perhaps generatorsTuningMap in this context becomes "variable part of mapped side", 
and like, all five of these new variables get packaged up as like... solutionObjects or something much much better than that lol
but I hope it doesn't have to come to that. actually by the end of this commit I got things way more consistent
across all vs list and the four solutions, than I had it at the time I wrote those sorts of worrying thoughts
- and honestly it doesn't even seem like it really handles complexitySizeFactor yet anyway,
like, these generator tuning maps it conjures, mightn't they need to be augmented? 
not sure, but I don't think it's tested one way or the other yet.
none of the three problem-child-marked methods in targetingAll.m actually ever augment what they return, I mean.
- it certainly doesn't yet do the preening of the final junk generator when returning the result, as do other solutions.
once you're done deprobelmatizing/standardizing this guy, you should be able to centralize that handling somewhere
perhaps even in optimizeGeneratorsTuningMap way up top, so you don't have to handle it the same way in multiple spots.
- there's also the matter of the getTargeting(All/List)GeneratorsTuningMap
which this is a semi-problem-child for, that is, one of two users (the other being the general power solution)
I'd really like to look into to what extent this is actually used / needed
*)
(* TODO: W/R/T COMPLEXITY SIZE FACTOR REFACTOR: handle targeting-list tunings
I also just need to test some targeting-list tuning which uses integer-limit complexity, 
so I can prove that this still works, 
that is, that it can just use the non-square Weil complexity multiplier as normal still.
- Note that one big insight of this whole refactor was that we should still think of the dualMultiplier 
when it applies to the primes
not as multiplying them directly
because that changes their shape
and we need to handle that in another way
rather
we need to think of it in the same way we think of damage weighting
where it's just a k\[Times]k matrix matrix
with an entry for each targeted interval
and that value inside that entry is just the log integer-limit complexity of that prime
which is of course just the same as its log product complexity, since it's a prime
but THAT complexity can be calculated using the non-square weil matrix, just fine, and should be.
- and when I say "handle that in another way"
I mean that when dealing with the whole dual norm effect of integer limit style tunings
it's not enough to just use a transformation matrix
you have to really straight up surgically add those extra rows and cols of k's, 0's, and -1's.
and that's what I'm doing in these new `getTargetingAllJustSide` type functions
- also note that while the wiki says you can simply use the pseudoinverse of the weil weighter for WE. and that's true!
it was too gross to me as an exception, that only for minimax did we do this manhandling of the mapped and just sides
so I now realize that in every solution
and it still works for WE
so it's doing more computation than it needs to do... everything cancels out
but I think it's the right move from a code design and conceptualization standpoint
