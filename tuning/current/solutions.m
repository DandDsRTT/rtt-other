  (*   
  our goal is to find the generator tuning map not merely with minimaxed damage, 
  but where the next-highest damage is minimaxed as well, and in fact every next-highest damage is minimaxed, all the way down.
  the tuning which has all damages minimaxed within minimaxed all the way down like this we can call a "nested-minimax".
  it's the only sensible optimum given a desire for minimax damage, so in general we can simply still call it "minimax".
  though people have sometimes distinguished this tuning from the range of minimax tunings with a prefix, 
  such as "TIPTOP tuning" versus "TOP tunings", although there is no value in "TOP tunings" given the existence of "TIPTOP",
  so you may as well just keep calling it "TOP" and refine its definition. anyway...
  
  the `findAllNestedMinimaxTuningsFromPolytopeVertices` function this function calls may come back with more than one result. 
  the clever way we compute a nested-minimax uses the same polytope vertex searching method used for the that first pass, but now with a twist.
  so in the basic case, this method finds the vertices of a tuning polytope for a temperament.
  this is the area inside of which the targeted intervals are as close as possible to just (by the definition of minimax damage, anyway).
  so now, instead of running it on the case of the original temperament versus JI, we run it on a distorted version of this case.
  specifically, we run it on a case distorted so that the previous minimaxes are locked down.
  
  we achieve this by picking one of these minimax tunings and offset the just side by it. 
  it doesn't matter which minimax tuning we choose, by the way; they're not sorted, and we simply take the first one.
  the corresponding distortion to the mapped side is trickier, 
  involving the differences between this arbitrarily-chosen minimax tuning and each of the other minimax tunings.
  note that after this distortion, the original rank and dimensionality of the temperament will no longer be recognizable.
  
  we then we search for polytope vertices of this minimax-locked distorted situation.
  and we repeatedly do this until we eventually find a unique, nested-minimax optimum. 
  once we've done that, though, our result isn't in the form of a generators tuning map yet. it's still distorted.
  well, with each iteration, we've been keeping track of the distortion applied, so that in the end we could undo them all.
  after undoing those, voilÃ , we're done!

  here we're iterating by index of the targeted intervals,

  but this doesn't necessarily happen, and if it does, it's handled by the function that calls this function)
  until by the final pass they are what we want to return.
  
  there's an inner loop by candidate tuning, and since that list is shrinking each time, the size of the inner loop changes.
  in other words, we're not covering an m \[Times] n rectangular grid's worth of possibilities; more like a jagged triangle.
  
  note that because the damages have all been sorted in descending order,
  these target "indices" do not actually correspond to an individual targeted interval.
  that's okay though because here it's not important which target each of these damages is for.

  we only check as many targets as we could possibly nested-minimax by this point.
  that's why this method doesn't simply always return a unique nested-minimax tuning each time.
  this is also why the damages have been sorted in this way
  so first we compare each tuning's actual minimum damage,
  then we compare each tuning's second-closest-to-minimum damage,
  then compare each third-closest-to-minimum, etc.
  the count of target indices we iterate over is a running total; 
  each time it is increased, it goes up by the present generator count plus 1.
  why it increases by that amount is a bit of a mystery to me, but perhaps someone can figure it out and let me know.

  (* here we iterate over every combination of r (rank = generator count, in the basic case) targets 
  and for each of those combinations, looks at all permutations of their directions. 
  these are the vertices of the maximum damage tuning polytope. each is a generator tuning map. the minimum of these will be the minimax tuning.
  
  e.g. for target intervals 3/2, 5/4, and 5/3, with 2 generators, we'd look at three combinations (3/2, 5/4) (3/2, 5/3) (5/4, 5/3)
  and for the first combination, we'd look at both 3/2 Ã 5/4 = 15/8 and 3/2 Ã· 5/4 = 6/5.
  
  then what we do with each of those combo perm vertices is build a constraint matrix. 
  we'll apply this constraint matrix to a typical linear equation of the form Ax = b, 
  where A is a matrix, b is a vector, and x is another vector, the one we're solving for.
  in our case our matrix A is M, our mapping, b is our primes tuning map p, and x is our generators tuning map g.
  
  e.g. when the targets are just the primes (and thus an identity matrix we can ignore),
  and the temperament we're tuning is 12-ET with M = [12 19 28] and standard interval basis so p = [logâ2 logâ3 logâ5],
  then we have [12 19 28][gâ] = [logâ2 logâ3 logâ5], or a system of three equations:
  
  12gâ = logâ2
  19gâ = logâ3
  28gâ = logâ5
  
  Obviously not all of those can be true, but that's the whole point: we linear solve for the closest possible gâ that satisfies all well.
  
  Now suppose we get the constraint matrix [1 1 0]. We multiply both sides of the setup by that:
  
  [1 1 0][12 19 28][gâ] = [1 1 0][logâ2 logâ3 logâ5]
  [31][gâ] = [logâ2 + logâ3]
  
  This leaves us with only a single equation:
  
  31gâ = logâ6
  
  Or in other words, this tuning makes 6/1 pure, and divides it into 31 equal parts.
  If this temperament's mapping says it's 12 steps to 2/1 and 19 steps to 3/1, and it takes 31 steps to a pure 6/1,
  that implies that whatever damage there is on 2/1 is equal to whatever damage there is on 3/1, since they apparently cancel out.
  
  This constraint matrix [1 1 0] means that the target combo was 2/1 and 3/1, 
  because those are the targets corresponding to its nonzero elements.
  And both nonzero elements are +1 meaning that both targets are combined in the same direction.
  If the targeted intervals list had been [3/2, 4/3, 5/4, 8/5, 5/3, 6/5] instead, and the constraint matrix [1 0 0 0 -1 0],
  then that's 3/2 Ã· 5/3 = 5/2.
  
  The reason why we need all the permutations is because they're actually anchored 
  with the first targeted interval always in the super direction.
